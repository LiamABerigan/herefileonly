Package: herefileonly
Type: Package
Title: Performs functions of the here package, but only in respect to .here files
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Modified from the here package by Kirill Müller
Maintainer: Liam Berigan <liamaberigan@gmail.com>
Description: The here package by Kirill Müller is a useful way to implement safe, relative paths in a file directory. However, 
    the package doesn't work well when projects are stored in a different subdirectory than the data.
    This slight modification to the package responds only to the presence of a .here file, which should be placed in a directory 
    which is parent to both the RProject and the data.
